Notes from submitter (u3230111):
Here is my final submission for this unit! While this website is admittedly
not as polished as I was hoping it to be, this showcases the skills I have
this learnt as a beginner so I hope you enjoy. 

Some things to note: 
I had omitted the fact that you can use any alphabetical key to exit the 
welcome pop-up. That is one of the flaws of this website, as I had intended 
it to be any key. 
Another flaw is that the webpage is glitchy on the scrolling. This is an 
issue with the CSS, but troubleshooting was difficult, so I apologise for any 
inconvenience this may cause you. 

Also please note that I have included some scrapped work in my Javascript 
file to showcase where I have failed but also where my ideas were initially 
going with this project. I hope that, by leaving it in the folder, it may
give you an idea of where I have improved or what areas I need to work on. 

Thank you, I hope you enjoy! :D
